	<title>A BitBake Hello World</title>
	<section>
		<title>BitBake Hello World</title>
		<para>The simplest example commonly used to demonstrate any new
			programming language or tool is the
			<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program">Hello World</ulink> 
			example.
			This chapter demonstrates, in tutorial form, Hello 
			World within the context of BitBake.
			This tutorial describes how to create a new Project 
			and the applicable metadata files necessary to allow
			BitBake to build it.

<section>
	<title>Obtaining BitBake</title>
	<para>Please refer to Chapter 1 Section 1.7 for the various methods to
	obtain BitBake.
	Once the source code is on your machine the BitBake directory will
	appear as follows:
		<screen>
			$ ls -al
			total 100
			drwxrwxr-x. 9 wmat wmat  4096 Jan 31 13:44 .
			drwxrwxr-x. 3 wmat wmat  4096 Feb  4 10:45 ..
			-rw-rw-r--. 1 wmat wmat   365 Nov 26 04:55 AUTHORS
			drwxrwxr-x. 2 wmat wmat  4096 Nov 26 04:55 bin
			drwxrwxr-x. 4 wmat wmat  4096 Jan 31 13:44 build
			-rw-rw-r--. 1 wmat wmat 16501 Nov 26 04:55 ChangeLog

			-rw-rw-r--. 1 wmat wmat  2887 Nov 26 04:55 TODO
		</screen>
		</para>
		
		<para>At this point you should have BitBake extracted or cloned to
			a directory and it should match the directory tree above.  
			Please note that you'll see your username wherever 
			"wmat" appears above.
		</para>

<section>
	<title>Setting Up the BitBake Environment</title>
	<para>The recommended method to run BitBake is from a directory of your
	choice.
	The directory can be within your home directory or in /usr/local,
	depending on your preference.
	Let's run BitBake now to make sure it's working.
	From the BitBake source code directory issue the following command:
		<screen>$ ./bin/bitbake --version
			BitBake Build Tool Core version 1.19.0, bitbake version
			 1.19.0
		</screen>
		You're now ready to use BitBake.
	</para>
		
	<para>Note that if you're a Vim user, you will find useful
			Vim configuration contributions in the 
			<emphasis>contrib/vim</emphasis> 
			directory.
			Copy the files from that directory to your 
			<emphasis>/home/yourusername/.vim</emphasis> 
			directory.
			If it doesn't exist, create it, and restart Vim.
		</para>

	<section>
		<title>The Hello World Example</title>
		<para>The following example leaps directly into how BitBake
			works.  
			Every attempt is made to explain what is happening,
			however, further information can be found in the
			Metadata chapter.
		</para>
		<para>The overall goal of this exercise is to create a Hello
			World example utilizing concepts used to
			build and construct a complete example application
			including Tasks and Layers.  
			This is how modern projects such as OpenEmbedded and 
			the Yocto Project utilize BitBake, therefore it 
			provides an excellent starting point for understanding
			BitBake.
