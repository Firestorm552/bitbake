  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>BitBake is a tool for executing tasks commonly performed by software
	  developers when building embedded Linux systems on a daily basis.
	  BitBake can build systems consisting of numerous individual pieces
	  of software, or can be used to build a single application.
	  Example tasks that BitBake can execute are fetching source code,
	  applying patches to source code, configuring, compiling, and
	  packaging applications into a complete system, and managing metadata.i
	  Metadata is stored in recipe (.bb), configuration (.conf), and class
	  (.bbclass) files and provide to BitBake the instructions for which
	  sources to build and how to build them.
	  BitBake abstracts the information for completing individual tasks
	  into files known as recipes.
	  Recipes contain all of the relevant information required by BitBake
	  to complete a given task including dependencies, source file
	  locations, etc.
	  BitBake is similar to <link urel='http://www.gnu.org/software/make/'>GNU Make</link> and other build tools.

	  <title>History and Goals</title>
	  <para>BitBake was originally a part of the OpenEmbedded project.
		  It was inspired by the Portage package management system
		  used by the Gentoo Linux distribution.
		  On December 7, 2004, OpenEmbedded project team member,
		  Chris Larson split the project into two distinct pieces:
		  <itemizedlist>
			  <listitem>BitBake, a generic task executor</listitem>
			  <listitem>OpenEmbedded, a metadata set utilized by
				  BitBake.
			  </listitem>
			  Today, BitBake is the primary basis of the
			  <ulink url="http://www.openembedded.org/"> OpenEmbedded</ulink>
			  project, which is being used to build and maintain a
			  number of projects and embedded Linux distributions
			  such as the Angstrom Distribution and the Yocto
			  Project.
	</para>
	<para>Prior to BitBake, no other build tool adequately met the needs of
		an aspiring embedded Linux distribution.
		All of the buildsystems used by traditional desktop Linux
		distributions lacked important functionality, and none of the
		ad-hoc <emphasis>buildroot</emphasis>systems, prevalent in the
		embedded space, were scalable or maintainable.
	</para>
	<para>Some important original goals for BitBake were:
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>Handle crosscompilation.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Handle interpackage dependencies (build
					time on target architecture, build time
					on native architecture, and
					runtime).
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Support running any number of tasks
					within a given package, including, but
					not limited to, fetching upstream
					sources, unpacking them, patching them,
					configuring them,
					etc.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Must be Linux distribution agnostic (both
					build and target).
				</para>
		        </listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Must be architecture agnostic
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Must support multiple build and target
					operating systems (including Cygwin,
					the BSDs, etc).
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Must be able to be self contained, rather
					than tightly integrated into the build
					machine's root filesystem.
				</para>
		        </listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>There must be a way to handle conditional
					metadata (on target architecture,
					operating system, distribution,
					machine).
				</para>
	                </listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>It must be easy for the person using the
					tools to supply their own local
					metadata and packages to operate
					against.
				</para>
	                </listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Must make it easy to collaborate between
					multiple projects using BitBake for
					their builds.
				</para>
		        </listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Should provide an inheritance mechanism
					to share common metadata between many
					packages.
				</para>
		        </listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	</para>
        <para>Over time it has become apparent that some further requirements
		were necessary: 
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>Handle variants of a base recipe (native,
					sdk, multilib).
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Able to split metadata into layers and
					allow layers to override each other.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Allow representation of a given set of
					input variables to a task as a
					checksum.
					Based on that checksum, allow
					accelleration of builds with prebuilt
					componenets.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	</para>
	<para>BitBake satisfies all the original requirements and many more
		with extensions being made to the basic functionality to
		reflect the additionl requirements.
		Flexibility and power have always been the priorities.
		It is highly extensible, supporting embedded Python code and
		execution of any arbitrary tasks.
